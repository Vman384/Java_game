REQ2 introduces the alien bug and Suspicious Astronaut entity,
implemented as Spawnable for crater being able to spawn it via spawnrules and Spawner.

Each actor class defines its behavior through separate Behavior classes (FollowAndWanderBehaviour, PickUpScrapsBehaviour, etc).
By encapsulating behavior into separate classes, the design promotes modularity and reusability,
allowing for easier maintenance and extension of the codebase.

Alien bug features two behaviors: PickUpScrapsBehavior and FollowAndWanderBehavior,
both implementing the Behavior interface.

PickUpScrapsBehavior simply checks for items at the actor's location, offering simplicity and reliability.

FollowAndWanderBehavior, on the other hand, checks for nearby interns to follow.
It utilizes a composition of WanderBehavior for flexibility and code reuse,
when there is no Actors to follow.

Items dropping upon actor death is handled in the unconscious method of the NPC class.
This is because Actor cannot be modified where it would make most logically sense,
therefore in NPC, we've chosen to override this method.
Although creating a new abstract class was considered, it was deemed unnecessary abstraction.
Thus, NPC handles item dropping, with plans to extend similar functionality to Actor class if required in the future.
We also considered adding it to the attackAction, however, this violated SRP, and therefore moved this to the
NPC class.

Suspicious Astronaut entity on the other hand reused the attackBehaviour
and added the capability to attack the intern. also used
Integer.MAX_VALUE to deal ultimate dmg.
